## ‚ú® Overview

This project presents a robust and user-friendly web-based PDF reader with an integrated "Read Aloud" feature. Built using pure HTML and JavaScript, it leverages the powerful PDF.js library to render PDF documents directly in your browser, and the Web Speech API for seamless text-to-speech functionality. Users can load PDFs from URLs or local files, navigate through pages, and have selected text or entire pages read aloud with customizable voices and reading speeds.

This application is designed for accessibility and convenience, making PDF content more interactive and approachable.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works (Technical Deep Dive)

This application is a single-page HTML file (`pdfreaderX.html`) that combines HTML for structure, CSS (via Tailwind CSS) for styling, and JavaScript for all its dynamic functionality.

### 1. PDF Loading & Rendering

* **PDF.js Integration:** The core PDF rendering is handled by [PDF.js](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/), a JavaScript library developed by Mozilla. It takes a PDF document (either as a URL or an `ArrayBuffer` from a file) and converts its pages into images on an HTML `<canvas>` element.
* **`pdfjsLib.getDocument()`:** This asynchronous function is used to load the PDF.
* **`page.render()`:** Each page is rendered onto the `<canvas>` element using the `page.render()` method, which draws the visual content.

### 2. Interactive Text Layer

* **Invisible Overlay:** Crucially, PDF.js provides a `TextLayerBuilder` (or in this custom implementation, manually created `div` elements) that overlays invisible, selectable text elements on top of the rendered PDF canvas. These `div` elements mimic the layout and position of the actual text on the PDF.
* **Purpose:** This invisible text layer allows users to **select text** with their mouse, just like they would in a native PDF reader. This selection is essential for the "Play Selection" feature. The `opacity: 0.001` and `color: transparent` CSS properties make these `div`s visually invisible while still being interactive.
* **Synchronization:** The JavaScript dynamically creates these text `div`s and positions them precisely over the canvas content, ensuring that what you see and what you can select are aligned.

### 3. Text-to-Speech (TTS) with Web Speech API

* **`window.speechSynthesis`:** This built-in browser API (`SpeechSynthesis`) is the engine for all voice-related functionality.
* **`SpeechSynthesisUtterance`:** When text needs to be spoken, a `SpeechSynthesisUtterance` object is created. This object holds the text, desired voice, and speaking rate.
* **`synth.speak()`:** The `SpeechSynthesis` instance (`synth`) then uses its `speak()` method to convert the `SpeechSynthesisUtterance` into audible speech.
* **Voice Management:**
    * `synth.getVoices()` is used to fetch all available voices on the user's system.
    * These voices are populated into a `<select>` dropdown, allowing users to choose their preferred narrator.
    * A default voice (e.g., "Microsoft Andrew Online (Natural)" or any English voice) is attempted to be selected for immediate use.
* **Playback Controls:** `synth.pause()`, `synth.resume()`, and `synth.cancel()` are used to control the speech playback.

### 4. Dynamic Highlighting

This project employs two distinct highlighting mechanisms:

* **TTS Word Highlighting (`highlighted-word` class):**
    * The `SpeechSynthesisUtterance` object fires `onboundary` events as it speaks. These events provide `charIndex` and `charLength`, indicating the current word's position within the spoken text.
    * The JavaScript identifies the corresponding text `div` element from the `textLayer` that contains the spoken word.
    * Instead of trying to wrap individual words with `<span>` elements (which can be fragile with PDF text layouts), the **entire `div` containing the word is temporarily assigned the `highlighted-word` CSS class**. This provides a consistent and visually clear highlight as the speech progresses.
    * The `removeHighlights()` function ensures these temporary highlights are cleared after speaking or upon user action.
* **User Selection Highlighting (`user-selection-highlight` class):**
    * When a user selects text in the `textLayer` (detected via `mouseup` and `selectionchange` events), the `applyUserSelectionHighlight()` function is triggered.
    * It retrieves the user's `window.getSelection()` range.
    * For each text node within the selected range, it attempts to `surroundContents()` with a `<span>` element carrying the `user-selection-highlight` class. This creates a precise visual highlight that matches the user's selection.
    * A `removeUserSelectionHighlight()` function ensures these highlights are cleared when the selection changes or is cleared.

### 5. Responsive Design

* **Tailwind CSS:** The project utilizes Tailwind CSS for its styling, enabling a utility-first approach to quickly build a responsive and modern UI.
* **`viewport` Meta Tag:** The `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">` ensures proper scaling on mobile devices.
* **Fluid Widths:** The PDF canvas and control containers use relative widths (`width: 100%`, `max-width`) and Tailwind's responsive classes (`sm:flex-row`, `flex-grow`) to adapt to different screen sizes.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To run this PDF reader locally, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Clone the repository (or download the file):**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/wikicrafter/pdfreaderX.git
    cd pdfreaderX
    ```
    

2.  **Open `pdfreaderX.html` in your web browser:**
    Simply double-click the `pdfreaderX.html` file. Most modern browsers will execute the JavaScript directly.

3.  **Explore the features:**
    * The demo PDF will load automatically from the default URL.
    * Try uploading your own PDF using "Load from File".
    * Select text and click "Play Selection".
    * Click "Read Current Page" to listen to the whole page.
    * Adjust speed and voice in the controls section.

## üõ£Ô∏è Future Enhancements & React Migration

This project, while functional, serves as a strong foundation. We have exciting plans to enhance its architecture and capabilities:

* **React.js Conversion:**
    * **Goal:** The primary future goal is to migrate the entire application to **React.js**.
    * **Benefits:** This transition will allow us to:
        * **Component-Based Architecture:** Break down the UI into reusable, modular components (e.g., `PdfViewer`, `ControlPanel`, `VoiceSelector`).
        * **State Management:** Utilize React's state management (e.g., `useState`, `useContext`, or potentially Redux/Zustand for larger applications) for more predictable and maintainable data flow.
        * **Improved Scalability:** Facilitate easier addition of new features and complex interactions without tangled DOM manipulations.
        * **Better Developer Experience:** Leverage the React ecosystem, including developer tools and a vast community.
        * **Potential for Modern Features:** Integrate with other React libraries for advanced UI/UX (e.g., Shadcn UI, Recharts).
* **Accessibility Improvements:** Further enhance ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation.
* **Performance Optimizations:** Optimize rendering for very large PDF documents.
* **User Settings Persistence:** Save user preferences (last PDF opened, voice, speed) using local storage or a backend.
* **Annotation Tools:** Add features like highlighting, notes, and drawing directly on the PDF.
* **Search Functionality:** Implement in-document text search.
